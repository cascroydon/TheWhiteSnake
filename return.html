  <h1>The White Snake</h1>
  <p>You quickly return the silver plate to the kitchen and hope that nobody noticed.</p>
  <p>Later that day, you are called to see the king.</p>
  <p>"The queen has lost one of her most beautiful rings, and you have been acting suspiciously. Find the thief by morning or you will be punished for the crime!"</p>
  
  <p>Did you <a href="tasted-snake.html">taste the snake</a> or <a href="ignored-snake">or return it without touching it</a>?</p>
