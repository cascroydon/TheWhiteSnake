    <h1>The White Snake</h1>
    <p>You are led out to the sea. A ring is thrown into it. You are told to fetch it, and if you come out of the water without it, you&apos;ll be pushed back into the sea and have to die in the water.</p>
    <p>You stand on the shore, contemplating your journey.</p>
    <p>If the fish promised to repay you, you can <a href="look-for-fish.html">look for them</a> in the water, otherwise you <a href="no-help.html">continue without help</a>.</p>
