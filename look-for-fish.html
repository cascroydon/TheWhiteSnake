    <h1>The White Snake</h1>
    <p>You see the three fish that you took from the reeds and threw back into the water swimming toward you. One of the fish holds a shell in its mouth, and the ring is in the shell. The fish sets it down on the beach at your feet. So you bring the ring to the king and claim the kingdom. But when the king sees that you are not a noble, he sets a further challenge. He has ten sacks of millet seeds scattered in the grass. You are to pick them all up before sunrise, and you must gather every single grain or else you lose your life.</p>
    <p>If the ant queen promised to repay you, you can <a href="look-for-ant-queen.html">look for her</a> in the grass, otherwise you <a href="no-help.html">continue without help</a>.</p>
