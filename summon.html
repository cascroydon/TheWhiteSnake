  <h1>The White Snake</h1>
    <p>&ldquo;The queen has lost one of her most beautiful rings,&rdquo; says the king, &ldquo;and you have been acting suspiciously. Find the thief by morning or you will be punished for the crime!&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>Did you <a href="tasted-snake.html">taste the snake</a> or <a href="search-for-ring.html">or return it without touching it</a>?</p>
