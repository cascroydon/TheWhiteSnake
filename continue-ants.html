    <h1>The White Snake</h1>
    <p>You ride on, and a while later you hear an ant queen crying out: &ldquo;Get away from us! Your enormous beast is trampling us with his large hooves!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>You look down to the ground and see that your horse has stepped on an ant hill.</p>
    <p>Will you <a href="turn-horse.html">turn your horse</a> away, or ignore the ant queen and <a href="continue.html">continue</a> your journey.</p>
