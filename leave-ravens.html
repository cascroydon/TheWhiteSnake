    <h1>The White Snake</h1>
    <p>You move on until you come to a large city. You hear a proclamation that the king is dying and has no heir. He intends to bequeath his kingdom to whoever can complete his task. But those who cannot complete the task, forfeit their lives. Many lords had already tried and lost their lives, so there was nobody any more who dared to try. This is why he had the proclamation issued again.</p>
    <p>Will you <a href="take-the-challenge.html">take the challenge</a>, or <a href="offer-service.html">offer your service</a> to the dying king.</p>
