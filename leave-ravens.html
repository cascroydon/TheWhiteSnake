    <h1>The White Snake</h1>
    <p>You move on until you come to a large city. You hear a proclamation that the king is dying and has no heir. He intends to bequeath his kingdom to whoever can complete his task. But those who cannot complete the task, will forfeit their lives. Many lords have already tried and lost their lives, so there is nobody any more who dares to try. This is why he is reissuing the proclamation.</p>
    <p>Will you <a href="take-the-challenge.html">take the challenge</a>, or <a href="offer-service.html">offer your service</a> to the dying king.</p>
