    <h1>The White Snake</h1>
    <p>The king provides you with money and the very best horse in his stables.</p>
    <p>In the morning you ride off and come to a pond where three fish are trapped in the reeds and wailing that they&apos;ll die if they can&apos;t get back in the water.</p>
    <p>Will you <a href="help-fish.html">help the fish</a>, or <a href="eat-fish.html">take them</a> for your supper?</p>
