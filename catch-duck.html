  <h1>The White Snake</h1>
    <p>You catch the duck and take it to the cook.</p>
    <p>The cook cuts off the duck&apos;s head and begins to clean it when he finds the queen&apos;s ring lying in its stomach. You take the ring back to the king who is astonished and happy. He is sorry that he doubted you and says, &ldquo;Demand whatever position of royal honour you would like.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Would you like <a href="travel.html">a horse and money to travel the world</a>, or <a href="title.html">a title and land within the kingdom</a>?</p>
