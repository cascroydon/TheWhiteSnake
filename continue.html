    <h1>The White Snake</h1>
    <p>Soon, you enter a forest where two ravens are throwing their young ones out of their nests. &ldquo;You are big enough now,&rdquo; say the ravens, &ldquo;you can feed yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The young birds lay on the ground and scream, &ldquo;We will die from starvation because our wings are too small. We cannot fly yet and search for food.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>If you have some smoked fish, you can <a href="feed-ravens.html">feed the ravens</a>. Otherwise, you can kill your horse to <a href="feed-ravens.html">feed the ravens</a>, or <a href="leave-ravens.html">leave the ravens</a> and continue on your way.</p>
