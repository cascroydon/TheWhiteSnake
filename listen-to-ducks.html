    <h1>The White Snake</h1>
    <p>One of the ducks says, &ldquo;There is something heavy in my stomach. I ate the ring that the queen has lost.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>You catch the duck and take it to the cook. &ldquo;Kill this one, it&apos;s fat enough.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>So the cook cuts off the duck&apos;s head and begins to clean it when he finds the queen&apos;s ring lying in its stomach. You take the ring back to the king who is astonished and happy. He is sorry that he doubted you and says, &ldquo;Demand whatever position or reward you would like.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Would you like a horse and money to <a href="travel.html">travel</a> the world, or a <a href="title.html">title</a> and land within the kingdom?</p>
