  <h1>The White Snake</h1>
  <p>You cut a piece of the white snake meat to taste it. As soon as it touches your lips you hear a strange voice say, &ldquo;It looks very tasty.&rdquo; Another voice answers, &ldquo;Shall we get any!&rdquo; You look around nervously,
    but you see nobody around except a couple of small birds perched on your window sill.</p>
    <p>You return the plate to the kitchen and hope nobody noticed.</p>
    <p>Later, you are <a href="summon.html">summoned to see the king.</a></p>
