    <h1>The White Snake</h1>
    <p>Every day at noon you bring a covered silver plate to the king and leave him to dine alone. Eventually, curiosity gets the better of you. After collecting the plate from the king, you sneak it away to your room to take a peek.</p>
    <p>In your room, you carefully lift the lid and see a dish of white snake meat.</p>
    <p>Do you <a href="taste.html">taste</a> a piece, or <a href="return.html">return</a> the plate to the kitchen without touching the snake?</p>
