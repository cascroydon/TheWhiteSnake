  <h1>The White Snake</h1>
  <p>Every day at noon you bring a covered silver plate to the king and leave him to dine alone. Eventually, curiosity gets the better of you and after collecting the plate from the king, you sneak it away to your room to take a peak.</p>
  <p>In your room, you carefully lift the silver lid and see a dish of white snake meat. You greatly desire to taste it.</p>
  <p>Do you <a href="taste.html">taste</a> a piece, or <a href="return.html">return</a> the plate to the kitchen without touching the snake?</p>
