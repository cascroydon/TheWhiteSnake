    <h1>The White Snake</h1>
    <p>All at once, you see the ant queen with all her ants that you protected, and they pick up the millet seeds during the night and pour them back into the sacks. By morning they have finished the task. When the king sees the filled sacks he is astonished. But he demands that you perform a third task: you are to fetch an apple from the Tree of Life.</p>
    <p>If the ravens promised to repay you, you can <a href="look-for-raven.html">look for one</a> in the sky, otherwise you <a href="no-help.html">continue without help</a>.</p>
